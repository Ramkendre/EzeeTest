                        Membership is as per your plan and course. At present we are accepting registration
                        for MPSC (Pre) only. The plans are time dependent i.e. for One Year, Six Months
                        and Three Months. Please note that the course is same for all MPSC (Pre) plans but
                        the fee varies from plan to plan because of its time period. Those who want to finish
                        earlier can choose 3 months plan in which they can get tests and notes on alternate
                        days. In the same way, if you choose 6 months plan, you will get tests and notes
                        twice in a week, and for one year plan, you will get it every week. For further
                        details, pl refer to our</p>
